======================


.. contents::
    :local:

Check whether mutation blocks and genes are in the same TAD or TAD boundary.

Optional Arguments:

- `-h, --help`: Show this help message and exit

Required Arguments:

- `-in_BGfile IN_FILTERED_BLOCKUQGENE_FILE, --in_filtered_blockUqGene_file IN_FILTERED_BLOCKUQGENE_FILE`: Input filtered block and gene information file with unique gene name that is exported by dds_analysis collect_gene_names4blocks
- `-in_GPfile IN_GENE_POSITION_FILE, --in_gene_position_file IN_GENE_POSITION_FILE`: Input gene position file, a bed format file that indicates all gene start positions and end positions, which can be generated by hmst-seq-analyzer using a refFlat file
- `-in_TPfile IN_TAD_POSITION_FILE, --in_TAD_position_file IN_TAD_POSITION_FILE`: Input Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) position file, a bed format file that describes each TAD's start and end positions, sorted by chromosome position
- `-in_TBfile IN_TAD_BOUNDARY_FILE, --in_TAD_boundary_file IN_TAD_BOUNDARY_FILE`: Input Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundary file, a bed format file that indicates each TAD boundary's start and end positions, sorted by chromosome position
