1.	run_rat_part1_test.sh	DMR analysis is done in dmr_analysis and shall be ready before doing steps 2 , 3, and 4
2.	run_rat_part2_test.sh	find DMR overlapping with TSS or 5distance regions of DEGs
3.	run_rat_part3_test.sh	prepare files (e.g., mr regions not in enhancers and TSS (will be used as background mr list), 
					unique gene to DMRs in TSS or 5distance that overlapping to enhaners,
					all DMRs with DEG in TSS or 5distance regions )
				before running dds_analysis in step 4
4.	run_rat_part4_test.sh	run dds_analysis for detecting DMR and DEG assocaitons
