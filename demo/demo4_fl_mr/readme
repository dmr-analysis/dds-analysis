here we try to repeat the full analysis of bpb3, dmr_analysis, dds_analysis for 12 FL samples
# 1. make genome region files based on genecode gtf annotation file
	s1_run_annotation.sh

#2. do dds_analysis for mutatoin blocks based on genCode genome regions
	s2_do_dds_analysis_fl_14samples_mr_enhancers_gencode.sh

#3. map DMR to predifined genomic regions that based on gencode annotation regions
	s3_do_dmr_analysis_map2genome_gencode.sh

#4. prepare files before doing dmr vs deg analysis 
	s4_run_fl_preprocess.sh 

#if shell background list creater is failed then use the python code
#to create the background file list
#make_background_files.py

#5. do dds_analysis for predicting target genes of DMRs in either TSS or 5Distance regions
	s5_run_dtarget.sh
